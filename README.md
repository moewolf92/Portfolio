This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data Class at CMU!

# About Me
My name is Moe Wolf. I am a second year Master of Science candidate in the Health Care Policy and Management program at Heinz College. I am interested in learning how to create effective, simple, and compelling data visualizations to assist me in conveying the results of any research I have done to a variety of audiences. Following graduation, I hope to begin a career in health care policy, public health, or global health. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to use a variety of data visualization tools and how to create data visualizations in ways that convey the data in the best way for my audience
