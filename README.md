This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data Class at CMU!

# About Me
My name is Moe Wolf. I am a second year Master of Science candidate in the Health Care Policy and Management program at Heinz College. Following graduation, I hope to begin a career in health care policy, public health, or global health. Following a short stint of medical school in Italy, I came back to Pittsburgh to get my undergraduate degree in biochemistry. After taking a history class on the history of public health, I decided to switch majors to political science, since I decided to pursue a career in public health, specializing in health policy. Since coming to Heinz, I've learned how to use many helpful tools that I never thought I would be able to learn, such as R and python, in addition to many other qualitative skills. I look forward to adding the skills in this class to my toolbox!

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to use a variety of data visualization tools and how to create data visualizations in ways that convey the data in the best way for my audience.  I am interested in learning how to create effective, simple, and compelling data visualizations to assist me in conveying the results of any research I have done to a variety of audiences.
